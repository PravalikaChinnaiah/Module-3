# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
Add code here
~~~
x=eval(input())
print("'n' in tuple:", 'n' in x)

print("8 in tuple:", 8 in x)
~~~

## Result
Thus,the Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is created successfully.
